# Java Testing

## Tools

These are the preferred testing libraries for the majority of Java development teams at IMC, and what we will be using
during Development School. There are alternative libraries for most of these, but they are sufficiently similar that
there's no need to learn the other ones.

- Unit Testing Framework: [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- Mocking: [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org)
- Assertions: [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/)
- Maven Runner: [Surefire](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)/[Failsafe](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/)

## Recommended Reading Material

The above documentation websites have relatively high quality examples and tutorials, so we recommend starting with
those.
